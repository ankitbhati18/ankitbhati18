## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an aspiring full-stack developer with a growing passion for building intelligent and scalable web applications. I'm particularly interested in the MERN stack (MongoDB/MySQL, Express, React, Node.js) for modern web development, and I'm equally excited about the world of Artificial Intelligence, especially Natural Language Processing (NLP) and how machines can understand and generate human language.

With a solid foundation in Java and an eagerness to keep learning, I enjoy blending backend logic with frontend creativity, and experimenting with AI-powered features that make applications smarter and more user-friendly.

I'm currently focused on:

ðŸ”§ Building full-stack web apps using the MERN stack

ðŸ¤– Learning and implementing NLP models and AI tools

â˜• Enhancing my problem-solving skills with Java and data structures

I'm currently learning:
NextJs,Go

Other Frameworks I love :
Flask,Django...

Tools I have previously used:

Postman,Firebase,VScode,REST,Vercel,Git  


I'm always exploring new technologies and looking forward to collaborating on innovative projects that solve real-world problems.
